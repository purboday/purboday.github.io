title: "Generating Sparse Communication Topologies to Improve the Performance and Fault-Tolerance of Disributed Peer-to-Peer Algorithms"
collection: projects
permalink: /projects/2022-07-01-toplinkmgr.md
excerpt: 'Developed a tool to generate virtual communication graphs between distributed peers based on any user specified topology, using Python and networkx. The topology could either be selected from a library of known types such as star or ring or could be custom built by describing the nodes and links, using a custom input language. Distributed algorithms mostly use fully connected communication for peer-to-peer algorithms that can have network badwidth isuues as they scale. Thus, sparse communication can be applied in such scenarios where only a subset of the available links are used. However, that leads to less information being exchanged, that can impact the performance of peer-to-peer algorithms. In order to strike a balance between the two, an algorithm called *Bounded Path Dissemination* was introduced that can dynamically alter the communication topology such that complete information dissemination is achieved within a bounded hop distance within a sparsely connected graph. The algorithm also contained fault-tolerance protocols to reconfigure the graph in the event of node crashes.
The work was part of an internship at [Siemens](https://www.siemens.com/us/en/company/siemens-in-the-usa/new-jersey.html) and was presented at the [2022 IEEE International Conference on Computer Communications and Networks (ICCCN)](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9868911)'
