About Me
=========

Hi! I am Purboday. I am a PhD. in Electrical Engineering from Vanderbilt University, where I worked under the guidance of Prof. Gabor Karsai at the department of ELectrical Engineering and Computer Science. I am a Cyber Physical Systems researcher who works at the interface of computing and physical processes in order to build highly scalable, safe and performant systems that can solve some of society's most challenging problems. Prior to moving to Vanderbilt in Nashville, I did my undergrad in Electrical and Communications Engineering from Jalpaiguri Government Engineering College in India, followed by three years working as a programmer analyst at Cognizant, a technology consutancy.
