About Me
=========

Hi! I am Purboday. I am a PhD. in Electrical Engineering from Vanderbilt University, where I worked under the guidance of Prof. Gabor Karsai at the department of ELectrical Engineering and Computer Science. I am a Cyber Physical Systems researcher who works at the interface of computing and physical processes in order to build highly scalable, safe and performant systems that can solve some of society's most challenging problems.

Research Interests
====================
I am interested in decentralized software pipelines on which sophisticated control and management applications for large scale cyber phsyical systems can be built, particularly in their fault-tolerance capabilities. The key question to ask in such tighty coupled systems is *how can the computing and physical layers be designed such that they can inform the considerations, features and assumptions of each other and react to changes in them to realize an integrated, robust system such that it is able to deliver the system specifications?* I have worked on distributed middleware for running distributed message-passing based systems utilizing various communication patterns such as publish-subscribe and client-server. I have extensively used model-based engineering concepts and techniques to represent the behavior of such systems.

For my dissertation titled *Fault Tolerance Design Approaches for Distributed Cyber Physical Systems with Applications in Energy Systems* I explored techniques to design fault-tolerant distributed applications that go beyond classical questions of fault-tolerant computing. Using case studies from the energy systems field, it highlights how the computing software and communication layer can detect and react to faults affecting the physical system and determine approaches to either mitigate it or recover from it.


Background
==============
Prior to moving to Vanderbilt in Nashville, I did my undergrad in Electrical and Communications Engineering from Jalpaiguri Government Engineering College in India, followed by three years working as a programmer analyst at Cognizant, a technology consutancy.
