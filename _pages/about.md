Hi! I am Purboday. I currently work as a Researcher at the [National Renewable Energy Laboratory](https://www.nrel.gov), where I work at the Grid Panning and Analysis Center.

I have a PhD. in Electrical Engineering from Vanderbilt University, where I worked under the guidance of [Prof. Gabor Karsai](https://engineering.vanderbilt.edu/bio/gabor-karsai) at the Vanderbilt [Institute for Software Integrated Systems](https://www.isis.vanderbilt.edu/). I am a cyber physical systems researcher who works at the interface of computing and physical processes in order to build highly scalable, safe and performant systems that can solve some of society's most challenging problems in areas such as power grids.

Research Interests
====================
I'm a researcher and software engineer working at the intersection of distributed systems and energy. My focus is on building simulation and optimization tools that support large-scale decision-making in electricity systems—from long-term planning to real-time control.

I’m especially interested in how decentralized software pipelines can enable resilient, fault-tolerant operation in cyber-physical systems. This includes co-designing the computing and physical layers so they can dynamically respond to failures, disturbances, or uncertainty in the real world—like equipment faults or extreme weather events.

At NREL, I work on multi-agent modeling and simulation tools in Julia to analyze electricity markets and grid infrastructure. Previously, I built cloud-based simulation platforms in Python and Django for battery storage revenue modeling and dispatch optimization. My PhD research explored fault-tolerant middleware and hardware-in-the-loop simulations for distributed control of microgrids.

I enjoy applying model-based engineering and data-driven techniques to energy problems, and I'm always looking for opportunities to collaborate on research that improves the robustness and intelligence of our critical infrastructure.

If you are interested in these areas and want to chat or collaborate, please feel free to reach out at `purboday [dot] ghosh [at] vanderbilt [dot] edu`.
